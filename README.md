Getting and Cleaning Data - Project

This file contains information required for executing "run_analysis.R" script.
Working directory should contain a directory called "UCI_HAR_Dataset". 
Training data should be stored in UCI_HAR_Dataset/train
Test data should be stored in UCI_HAR_Dataset/test
Filenames need to be retained as the ones supplied with original data.
Output would be stored in a file "averages.txt" which the program would create in the working directory.
